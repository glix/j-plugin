			<p><b style="color:red">Darkness</b> cannot drive out darkness: Only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: Only love can do that.</p>
			<p>Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. </p>
			<p>Yesterday is history, tomorrow is mystery, today is a gift of god, which is why we call it the present.</p>
			<p>Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.</p>
			<p>Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.</p>
			<p>The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep.</p>
